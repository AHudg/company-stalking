## -=Installation=-
Before running the program, install *inquirer*, *console table*, and *MYSQL2* npm dependencies with:
<div style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25); vertical-align: middle; padding:10px 20px; border-radius: 10px">
npm i
</div>
<br>
Inquirer allows us to retrieve user input to edit the database. Console table returns well structured data to the command line. Lastly, MYSQL was utiilized to host the database for this challenge.

<br>

## -=Usage=-
To run the code, type *node app.js* or *npm start* in the command line of the root directory. The application is all based within the command line using a cyclical main menu to allow the user to view multiple queries as well as alter the tables themselves.
